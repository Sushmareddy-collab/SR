# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews
Project Overview
This project performs Sentiment Analysis on a dataset of Amazon product reviews. The aim is to classify customer feedback into three sentiment categories: Positive, Neutral, and Negative. Additionally, the project explores trends in customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction across different product categories.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various Amazon product reviews, including text reviews, product ratings, and metadata such as the date of review and product categories.
Dataset Source: Amazon Product Reviews Dataset
File Used: Reviews.csv

Project Steps
The project workflow includes the following steps:

Data Collection:

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Missing data is handled, and the review text is cleaned by converting to lowercase, removing special characters, and stop words.
Sentiment Analysis:

Using the TextBlob library, each reviewâ€™s sentiment polarity is computed and categorized into Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiments.
Data Visualization:

Visualizations, including bar charts and word clouds, are generated to show the distribution of sentiments and the most common words in positive and negative reviews.
